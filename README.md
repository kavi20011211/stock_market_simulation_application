# Stock market simulation using C++
This application implemented by me using the basic knowledge of stock market. In future hope to continue this for a fully functional stock market simulator.
for now, this application can have multiple functionalities like, load market data, buy/sell stocks, track visual stock profiles, view real time stock data, analyze performance metrics.
I build this application mainly to cover the skills and major topics of cpp; OOP concepts, multithreading , advancef features, core functions, advanced system and modern C++.
